I expect this course to help me understand how complex systems are planned, built, and connected to serve the needs of organizations. I also believe it will teach me not only the basic ideas of system architecture but also how these are applied in real life, where businesses use integrated systems to become more efficient and successful.

I also expect this subject to improve my problem-solving and critical thinking skills. System integration often faces issues like compatibility, data handling, and smooth communication between different parts of a system. Because of this, I hope to learn useful strategies for solving these problems. I also look forward to studying modern tools, technologies, and methods that companies use today, as this will prepare me for future jobs in IT, where systems must always connect and work together.

I expect that this course will teach me the value of teamwork and cooperation. System integration is not only about technical work but also about working with different teams, understanding the needs of users, and making sure that the final system is safe and effective. By the end of this course, I hope to be more confident in using integration methods and system design principles, which will give me a strong foundation for my future career in information technology.
